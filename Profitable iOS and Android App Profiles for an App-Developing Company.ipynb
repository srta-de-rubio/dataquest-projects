Almost a fifth part of the free English applications is the Family applications (18,9 %) followed by only 9,7% of the Game apps. But if we check the Google Play Market, we´ll see that most of the Family apps are the children educational games as well. So we can confirm that although the fun applications are widely represented on the free English Google Play niche, they´ve got a smaller part if to compare with the Apple Store. 7 out of 10 first groups of applications are designed for practical purposes (tools, business, lifestyle, productivity, etc.) and account for more than 30% of total number of analysed apps.\n",

    "At a first sight it seems that the Book genre is only heavily influenced by big players like Kindle and Audible. But also it´s true to say that there are very few applications on the market of free book English applications. And if we come up with some free book application, it will be easier to stand out. Creating some kind of library means a lot of expenses related with copyrights. There're only 4 reader application, 2 of them is for reading manga. This niche is not saturated. Keeping in mind a social networking element, we could offer to develop a reader application with an integrated readers club inside the application where every month there'll be offered some books to read (it could be a built-in sale as an additional source of revenue) and to discuss afterwards.

    "This niche seems to be dominated by online shops and multiseller platforms. Definitely, it´s not a good idea to create an online shop because we don´t have any goods to sell, nether a multiseller platform because of the very high competition.  \n",

    "Also we´ve noticed that there´re quite a few applications that offer different coupons or special deals which suggests that building an app with some kind of promotions could be profitable. But it´s necessary to outstand from the exsiting apps. Generally this kind of apps offer a campaign planned beforehead to attract new customers. And the goods and services that are offered there are not something that we buy on a daily or a weekly basis. It seems that it could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets to creating an app where the deales are announced not by the retailer but by their clients (a crowd-powered) and where a user can get a notification of a last-moment deal like \"Cuttlefish eggs for only 9€ in the Carrefour of X street\".

    "We concluded that creating a crowd-powered app with last-minute special deals and discounts could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. The markets are already full of different discounts and coupon apps, but we suggest that the deals are listed by users (a social-networking element) and mostly oriented for daily purchases . And it's possible to add location and category filters so that the users only recieve relevant deals. "
