Project Name: Exploring Hacker News posts

Description: This project was done in studying purposes when completing the Python Intermediate Course on Dataquest.io.
In this project we are going to analyze a data set of submissions to a popular technology site Hacker News. Hacker News is a similar to reddit site where users-submitted stories, known as "posts", are voted and commented upon. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

Analyzing the data set of Hacker News post weÂ´ll pay a special attention to the posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN where users either ask the site community a specific question or share with the community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

    Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
    Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more points on average?
    Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
    Do posts created at a certain time receive more points on average?
